# Inefficient useEffect Hook Usage in React
This repository demonstrates a common mistake in using the `useEffect` hook in React: placing logic inside of `useEffect` that shouldn't run on every render. The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array runs only on component mount.  However, in this example, it is unintentionally being called each time the component re-renders, leading to inefficient performance. The solution is shown, demonstrating how to correctly use `useEffect` to run the effect only once after the component mounts.  The improved code avoids unnecessary re-renders and improves application performance.
